Submission Organization:
I've included my fullSystem, fullALU, decoder, and carrySelectAdder, as well as all of their respective testbenches. My discussion is titled 'ALU Discussion' and is also included in this submission.

Note: When I was demoing to Fadi, he seemed to be confused as to why my carrySelectAdder was implemented separately from my fullALU. I explained that you (Colin) told me that I could do it separately and just use behavioral logic in my fullALU. Just wanted to put this here in case the separate implementation becomes an issue. Thanks!
